<h3><em>FUN</em>damental Computer Training for Beginners and Senior Citizens</h3>
<h2>My fundamental computer training for beginners and senior citizens is an excellent way to learn about your computer. To start I focus on simple things like turning the computer on and off and working with the mouse and keyboard. I then urge you to use your computer for email and Internet searches because these are two great ways to make a computer an interesting tool for you to use. I then go on to teach you how to open software programs and how to get around the computer using Solitaire as a tool to enhance your skills.  Because I want you to have fun immediately I then go on to teach you a little bit about the Internet; discovering the World Wide Web. We take a look at Google and focus on helping you search and work on the Internet.
